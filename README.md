# Ruby Interview Tests

## Instructions

For each test, consult the appropriate .rb file. You will need to write some code to make it do the right thing. Browser is allowed. After you are done with the test the interviewer will review the results with you.

## Test 1: Message queue!

Look in `message_queue/`. Implement the code in `message_queue.rb`. Run with: `$ ./runner.rb`.

The assertions start basic and get increasingly complex.

Extra credit: check out `map_reduce.rb`

## Test 2: DOM parsing

The goal of this test is to write something that can parse XML to find HTML elements or perform operations on each one. There are a number of approaches to this so be prepared to talk about why you chose the approach you did and why it may be good or bad in certain cases.

Look in `dom/` and implement the code in `runner.rb`. Run with `$ ./runner.rb`. You can modify the sources however you need to complete the problem (including making new folders & files).

Side note: we use XML here for simplicitity and because it actually validates unlike lots of HTML.
